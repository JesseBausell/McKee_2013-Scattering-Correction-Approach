# McKee_2013-Scattering-Correction-Approach
Unaccounted scattering must be accounted for when using the WETLabs spectral absorption and attenuation meter (ac-s) with a 25 cm optical pathlength. McKee et al. (2013) devise an iterative method for correcting for unaccounted scattering inside flow tubes. This repository allows users to easily apply McKee et al.'s (2013) iterative approach
